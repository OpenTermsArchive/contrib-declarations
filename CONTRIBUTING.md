## ⭐ Why Open Terms Archive?

Digital platforms have the potential to shape international information flows, and manage personal data through their terms of service, privacy policies, community guidelines etc. As a result, they have a significant impact on societal development. Even the most devoted observers find it difficult to understand these terms documents  because of their quantity, frequency of change, and legalese. 

Open Terms Archive increases the readability and highlights the changes in these terms by openly recording them many times a day in various languages and regions. Our engine crawls through the terms added to the Archive, and creates issues whenever it is unable to read a document.

## 🚀 How to Contribute

We have a curated list of Hacktoberfest issues that are ready for you to pick up.
- You can contribute to every issue labeled `hacktoberfest` in this repository
- Each of these issues has to do with a term that is no longer being tracked, either because their source document was moved, or their website blocked our engine from crawling.
- Follow the step by step guide attached to the issue description to fix them.
- Before working on an issue, please let us know so we’ll assign it to you/ assign the issue to yourself, so we’ll know that you’re working on it.
- Watch [this video](https://youtube.com) for a vivid example of how to fix an issue.
