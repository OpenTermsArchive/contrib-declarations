# Open Terms Archive - Contrib

These services declarations are added and maintained by volunteer contributors, with occasional reviews from the Open Terms Archive core team. Most of these declarations were historically imported from TOSBack.org.

These service declarations are consumed by the [Open Terms Archive engine](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/engine). See the Open Terms Archive [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/engine/blob/main/docs/doc-contributing-documents.md) to learn how to add and update services or documents.

You can [explore the tracked versions](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/contrib-versions) interactively or [download them as a dataset](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/contrib-versions/releases) in the `OpenTermsArchive/contrib-versions` repository.

## Scope

The documents declared in this repository are:

- In any jurisdiction.
- In the English language.

Please note that due to its specific history of being the first instance of Open Terms Archive, before a clear architectural choice for decentralisation was taken, and being mostly based on non-curated imports of an existing fonds, this scope is unusually large and inconsistently enforced. We strongly encourage contributors to focus on [topical instances](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/engine/blob/main/README.md#instances) and use this instance only as a last resort.
