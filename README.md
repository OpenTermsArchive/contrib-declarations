# Open Terms Archive - Contrib

These services declarations are added and maintained by volunteer contributors, with occasional reviews from the Open Terms Archive core team. Most of these declarations were historically imported from TOSBack.org.

The terms listed in this collection are tracked by the [Open Terms Archive engine](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/engine). 

You can [explore the tracked versions](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/contrib-versions) interactively or [download them as a dataset](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/contrib-versions/releases) in the `OpenTermsArchive/contrib-versions` repository.

## Scope

The terms tracked by this repository are those of services that operate:

- In any industry.
- In any jurisdiction.
- In the English language.

Please note that due to its specific history of being the first instance of Open Terms Archive, before a clear architectural choice for decentralisation was taken, and being mostly based on non-curated imports of an existing fonds, this scope is unusually large and inconsistently enforced. We strongly encourage contributors to focus on [topical collections](https://opentermsarchive.org/#collections) and use this collection only as a last resort.

In order to contribute additional terms to this collection or correct existing ones, please read the guidelines on [targeting](https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/guidelines/targeting/) and [declaring](https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/guidelines/declaring/) terms.

## Suggested engine updates

In order to keep the Open Terms Archive engine up-to-date, updates will be automatically suggested by [Dependabot](https://github.blog/2020-06-01-keep-all-your-packages-up-to-date-with-dependabot/) in a pull request when a new version is available.

While engine updates follow the [semantic versioning](https://semver.org) standard and automated collection tests should provide a safety net, it is ultimately the responsibility of the maintainers of the collection to check version compatibility and potentially adjust the declarations before applying these updates.
